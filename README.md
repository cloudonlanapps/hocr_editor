# HOCR Editor

A flutter fullscreen widget, that displays hocr (xml) file along with original image and allows to edit the text in it. The current version allows to edit the words and delete words. Planning to make it is as a complete editor, where you
can manually add new words at specific position, search, merge blocks.

# Dependency
This package uses dart_hocr package for interacting with xml file.

# Editing controller
    Editing controller allows external interaction with the content. 

TODO: Document the interface for Editing controller
